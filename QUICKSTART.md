## What You've Accomplished

✅ Mix 1 uploaded and public
✅ Landing page live with email capture
✅ Distribution started (Reddit, Discord, Instagram)
✅ Foundation for repeatable process

**This is more than 90% of people who "want to start a YouTube channel" ever do.**

---

## Week 2 Preview (Optional)

If you want to keep momentum:
- **Day 8**: Research 3-5 competitor channels
- **Day 9**: Write your first newsletter (even if you have 2 subscribers)
- **Day 10**: Set up Discord server (3 channels: general, mix-feedback, track-sharing)
- **Day 11-14**: Start curating Mix 2

But honestly? **Take a break.** You shipped. That's enough for now.

---

## What to Ignore (For Now)

- Logo iterations (use what you have or text-based)
- Perfect SEO optimization (you don't have data yet)
- Paid ads (wait until Mix 3)
- Building elaborate project management systems
- Researching "YouTube growth hacks"
- Comparing your views to channels with 100K subs
- Planning your label/merch/monetization strategy

**None of that matters until you have 3+ mixes live.**

## If You Get Stuck

Read `/workflows/stop-doing-this.md` and check if you're falling into an overbuilding trap.

**Remember**: Momentum > perfection. Ship > polish. Done > perfect.

You've got this.
