# Data Directory

This directory stores converted data from the DJ library management system.

## Structure

```
/data/
  /rekordbox_library.json  # Converted Rekordbox library data
  /mixes/                  # Mix metadata JSON files
  /tracklists/             # Generated tracklists
```

## Files

### `rekordbox_library.json`
Generated by `scripts/rekordbox_parser.py`. Contains all tracks from your Rekordbox library with metadata:
- Title, artist, album, genre
- BPM, key (tonality)
- Rating, play count
- Date added
- File path

### `/mixes/`
Store mix metadata as JSON files. Each mix file should contain:
- Mix number/name
- Date recorded
- Tracklist
- YouTube URL (if uploaded)
- Performance metrics (views, engagement)

### `/tracklists/`
Generated tracklists in various formats (plain text, formatted for YouTube, etc.)

## Usage

1. Export your Rekordbox library to XML
2. Run `python scripts/rekordbox_parser.py path/to/rekordbox.xml`
3. The converted library will be saved to `rekordbox_library.json`
4. Use other scripts to generate tracklists, check copyright, etc.

## Note

This directory is for data files, not source code. Audio files should be stored elsewhere (local drive, cloud storage, etc.).
