## What You Need to Do Now

### Immediate (Next 10 Minutes)

1. **Copy your song collections/notes into `/content/`**
   - Create a file: `/content/track-inbox.md`
   - Paste your song lists, notes, whatever you have
   - Don't organize it—just get it into the repo

2. **Copy your logo/banner drafts into `/assets/`**
   - Put logos in `/assets/logos/`
   - Put banners in `/assets/banners/`
   - Even if you're "not sure" about them, just add them
   - You can decide later (after Mix 3)

3. **Tell me what other artifacts you have**
   - You mentioned you have "some data, like songs or collections of songs" in your inbox
   - What format are these in? (Spotify playlists? Text files? Excel?)
   - Where are they stored? (Google Drive? Local folders?)
   - I can help you process/organize them
