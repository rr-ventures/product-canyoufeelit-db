# Market Research Plan — Understanding the Landscape

**Goal**: Identify top competitors, understand what works, and find gaps you can exploit.

**Time budget**: 1-2 hours (Day 8 of 14-day plan)

---

## Part 1: Competitor Identification

### Search Terms to Use (YouTube)
Run these searches and note the top 5-10 channels for each:

1. **"trip hop mix"**
2. **"lofi mix emotional"**
3. **"late night music"**
4. **"downtempo mix"**
5. **"sad lofi beats"**
6. **"nostalgic trip hop"**
7. **"I miss her" + music** (emotional hook titles)
8. **"2am thoughts music"** (specific moment targeting)

### What to Look For
- Channels with 10K-500K subs (direct competitors, not mega-channels)
- Upload frequency (weekly, monthly, sporadic?)
- View-to-subscriber ratio (high = good content, low engagement = dead audience)
- Comment engagement (are viewers passionate or passive?)
- Title patterns (emotion-driven vs generic?)

---

## Part 2: Top Competitor Analysis (Fill Out 5 Channels)

For each channel, answer:

### Basic Stats
- Subscriber count
- Avg views per video (last 10 uploads)
- Upload frequency
- Channel age

### Content Strategy
- **Mix length**: 30min? 60min? 90min?
- **Title style**: Emotion-first? Genre-first? Generic?
- **Thumbnail style**: Static image? Animated? Text-heavy?
- **Tracklists**: Do they provide them? Timestamped?

### Audience Engagement
- **Comments**: High engagement? What do viewers say?
- **CTAs**: Do they ask for subs/likes? Email list? Discord?
- **Pinned comments**: What do they pin?

### What They Do Well
- Why are they successful?
- What can you learn from them?

### What They Miss (Your Opportunity)
- What's missing in their content?
- What do comments ask for that they don't provide?
- How can you differentiate?

---

## Part 3: Pattern Recognition

After analyzing 5 channels, look for patterns:

### Title Patterns That Work
- List 5-10 high-performing titles
- What do they have in common?
- Emotion-driven? Specific scenarios? Generic descriptors?

**Example findings**:
- "when you need to sleep" (27M views)
- "I miss her | sad lofi mix" (12M views)
- "late night drive music" (8M views)

**Pattern**: Specific emotional states + moment-in-time > generic genre descriptions

---

### Thumbnail Patterns That Work
- Simple text on gradient?
- Anime/illustration aesthetic?
- Photography + overlay?
- Minimalist design?

**Example findings**:
- High-performing thumbnails = high contrast, readable text, emotional imagery
- Low-performing = cluttered, generic stock photos, tiny text

---

### Common Mistakes Competitors Make

1. **Generic titles** ("Chill Beats Vol. 47")
2. **No tracklists** (viewers beg in comments: "Track at 12:30???")
3. **No CTA** (missing opportunity to build owned audience)
4. **Inconsistent uploads** (post 5 videos in a week, then disappear for 3 months)
5. **Low-quality track selection** (filler beats, no curation standards)
6. **Promising emotion, delivering elevator music** (your core differentiator)

---

## Part 4: Opportunity Mapping

### Underserved Niches
Where is there demand but weak supply?

**Example opportunities**:
- Emotion-driven titles + high-quality curation (most promise one, deliver neither)
- Real DJ craft (most are just playlists)
- Owned audience building (most rely 100% on YouTube algo)
- Authentic emotional connection (most are detached/corporate)

### Content Gaps
What do viewers ask for in comments that channels don't deliver?

**Research method**: Read top comments on competitor videos
- "What's the track at X:XX?" → They want tracklists
- "Finally, someone who gets it" → They want emotional resonance
- "Please make more like this" → They want consistency
- "I found this at the perfect time" → They want moment-specific mixes

---

## Part 5: Competitive Positioning

### Where Most Channels Compete
- Background music market (study beats, focus music, chill vibes)
- Algorithm-optimized content (SEO titles, generic thumbnails)
- Quantity over quality (posting 2-3x/week, low curation standards)

### Where You Compete
- Foreground listening (music for *feeling*, not background)
- Emotional authenticity (titles are promises you keep)
- Quality over quantity (1 mix every 2-4 weeks, high curation)
- Owned audience (email + Discord, not just YT subs)

### Your Unique Position
**"The only trip-hop mix channel with actual DJ craft, emotional depth, and a decade of curation behind every mix."**

No one else can claim all three:
1. Real DJ skills (not playlist compilers)
2. Emotional resonance (not generic vibes)
3. 15,000-song library (not algorithm picks)

---

## Part 6: Data to Track Over Time

Create a simple spreadsheet or table:

| Channel Name | Subs | Avg Views | Upload Freq | Our Advantage |
|--------------|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Channel A | 250K | 50K | 2x/month | Better curation |
| Channel B | 120K | 80K | 1x/week | Real DJ craft |
| Channel C | 500K | 30K | Sporadic | Consistency |

**Update this quarterly** to see:
- Who's growing? Why?
- Who's declining? What changed?
- What new channels are emerging?

---

## Part 7: Reverse-Engineer Success

Pick ONE high-performing video from a competitor (1M+ views).

### Analyze:
1. **Title**: What emotion/moment does it target?
2. **Thumbnail**: What makes it clickable?
3. **First 30 seconds**: How does it hook you?
4. **Track selection**: Are they actually good tracks?
5. **Comments**: What do viewers love about it?

### Adapt (Don't Copy):
- If emotion-driven title works → Use similar emotional hooks (different wording)
- If minimalist thumbnail works → Test minimalist design (different style)
- If strong opening hook works → Start your mixes with your best moment

**Rule**: Learn the principles, not the tactics. Copy the strategy, not the execution.

## Part 8: Action Items from Research

After completing this research, you should have:

1. **5 competitor profiles** (saved in `/research/competitor-analysis.md`)
2. **List of high-performing title patterns** (to test in your uploads)
3. **Thumbnail style direction** (what works in the niche)
4. **Content gaps you can fill** (your differentiation strategy)
5. **Realistic benchmarks** (what 100 views, 1K views, 10K views looks like at your stage)

## Quick Research Checklist (Use on Day 8)

- [ ] Run 5-8 YouTube searches in your niche
- [ ] Pick 5 channels to analyze (10K-500K subs)
- [ ] Fill out competitor profiles (save in `/research/competitor-analysis.md`)
- [ ] List 10 high-performing titles (note patterns)
- [ ] Screenshot 5 effective thumbnails (save in `/assets/other/thumbnail-inspo/`)
- [ ] Read top comments on 5 competitor videos (note what viewers want)
- [ ] Document your unique positioning (how you're different)
- [ ] Identify 3 content gaps you can exploit

**Time limit: 2 hours max**

Stop when you have enough insight to confidently create your first 3 mixes. You can research more later.

## Remember

**The goal of research is not to copy competitors. It's to understand the landscape so you can carve out your own space.**

You're not trying to beat them at their game. You're playing a different game entirely.

Your game: Emotional resonance + DJ craft + owned audience.

Their game: Algorithm hacking + volume + ad revenue.

Do your research. Then forget about them and focus on serving *your* people.
