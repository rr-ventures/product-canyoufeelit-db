## Competitive Positioning

**Where most channels compete**:
- Background music / study beats / "chill vibes"
- Quantity over curation
- No emotional depth or storytelling

**Where we compete**:
- Foreground music (active listening, not background)
- Emotional resonance + authentic curation
- Real DJ craft (transitions, cuts, story arc)
- Building owned audience (email/Discord) not just views

**Our unfair advantage**:
1. 15,000-song library of hand-picked gems
2. Actual DJ skills (not playlist compilers)
3. Willingness to go deep emotionally (not surface-level "chill")
4. Long-term asset mindset (not just ad revenue farming)
