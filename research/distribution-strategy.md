# Distribution Strategy — Platform Playbook

**Goal**: Get eyes on your mixes without spamming or buying fake engagement.

**Budget**: ~$100/week for experiments (Month 2+)

---

## Priority Tier (Focus Here First)

### 1. YouTube (Primary Home)
**Why**: Best platform for long-form audio + built-in discovery algorithm
**Strategy**:
- Upload 1 mix every 2-4 weeks
- Optimize for watch time (20-30min sweet spot)
- Use emotion-driven titles for search/browse traffic
- Engage with comments within 24 hours of posting
- Post to Community tab between uploads (once unlocked)

**Metrics to track**: Views, watch time %, traffic sources, CTR

**Time investment**: 2-3 hrs per upload (recording + metadata + upload)

---

### 2. Reddit (Organic Discovery)
**Why**: Active music communities, high intent listeners, direct traffic to YouTube
**Strategy**:
- Post to 2-3 relevant subreddits per upload
- Best subs: r/triphop, r/lofihiphop, r/chillmusic, r/downtempo, r/ambient
- Follow each sub's rules (some require certain post formats)
- Use format: `[Trip Hop] Title | 25min mix`
- Add 1 sentence about the vibe in the body
- Don't spam—wait 2-3 weeks between posts to same sub

**Metrics to track**: Upvotes, comments, YouTube traffic from Reddit (check analytics)

**Time investment**: 20-30 min per upload

---

### 3. Music Discord Servers (Community Seeding)
**Why**: Engaged listeners, potential superfans, direct feedback
**Strategy**:
- Join 5-10 music Discord servers (lofi, trip hop, electronic, chill beats)
- Introduce yourself in intro channel first
- Share mixes in promo/music-sharing channels only
- Participate in conversations (don't just drop links)
- Build relationships with other creators

**Metrics to track**: Reactions, YouTube traffic from Discord, DMs/feedback

**Time investment**: 30 min per upload + 1-2 hrs/week for community engagement

---

## Secondary Tier (Add After 3 Uploads)

### 4. Instagram (Visual Teaser)
**Why**: Good for brand building + short clips, limited direct traffic
**Strategy**:
- Static posts: Mix artwork + link in bio
- Stories: 15-30sec clip from mix with "Link in bio" CTA
- Reels: 30-60sec best moment from mix (test if it drives traffic)
- Use hashtags: #triphop #lofihiphop #chillbeats #latenightmusic (10-15 total)

**Metrics to track**: Link clicks (via Linktree/landing page), profile visits

**Time investment**: 30-45 min per upload

---

### 5. TikTok (High-Risk, High-Reward)
**Why**: Viral potential, younger demographic (aligns with target)
**Strategy**:
- 30-60sec clips from mix
- Use text overlay with emotion-driven hook ("POV: it's 2am and you're processing everything")
- Hashtags: #triphop #lofihiphop #latenight #emo #feelings
- Post 2-3 clips per mix (different moments)
- Test what resonates, double down on winners

**Metrics to track**: Views, shares, profile visits, YouTube traffic

**Time investment**: 1-2 hrs per upload (clip creation + posting)

---

## Tertiary Tier (Month 2+)

### 6. SoundCloud (Audio Backup)
**Why**: Some listeners prefer SoundCloud, good for searchability
**Strategy**:
- Cross-post full mixes
- Use same titles/descriptions
- Link to YouTube + landing page
- Minimal effort—just a backup presence

**Metrics to track**: Plays, reposts, comments

**Time investment**: 15 min per upload

---

### 7. Twitter/X (Optional)
**Why**: Music discovery community, threading potential
**Strategy**:
- Post mix with short thread: "Why I made this mix + 3 tracks that define it"
- Use relevant hashtags
- Engage with music community (like/reply to similar creators)

**Metrics to track**: Impressions, link clicks

**Time investment**: 20-30 min per upload

---

## Paid Traffic (Month 2+, $25-50 Tests)

### YouTube Ads
**Test**: $25 ad spend targeting "trip hop mix" + "late night lofi" search terms
**Goal**: Find cost per view/subscriber
**Success metric**: <$0.10 per view or <$2 per subscriber

### Reddit Ads
**Test**: $25 promoted post in r/triphop or r/lofihiphop
**Goal**: Test if paid promotion converts better than organic
**Success metric**: >5% CTR, views at <$0.15 each

### Instagram/Facebook Ads (Lower Priority)
**Test**: $50 ad to lookalike audience based on landing page visitors
**Goal**: Email signups
**Success metric**: <$2 per email signup

**Rule**: Only test paid once you have 3+ organic uploads and understand what content resonates.

## What NOT to Do (Distribution Anti-Patterns)

❌ Post the same mix link 10 times across Reddit in one day (spam = ban)
❌ Buy views/subs (kills channel credibility + algo ranking)
❌ DM strangers on Instagram "check out my mix" (annoying + ineffective)
❌ Post on 15 platforms simultaneously before knowing what works
❌ Run ads before you have 3+ uploads (no data to optimize)
❌ Beg for likes/subs in comments (desperate energy repels)
❌ Cross-post to LinkedIn (wrong audience entirely)

## Long-Term Growth Levers (Month 6+)

1. **Collaborations**: Feature other creators' tracks, ask them to share
2. **Playlists**: Get added to Spotify/YouTube playlists by curators (research + outreach)
3. **Influencer seeding**: Send mixes to micro-influencers in the niche
4. **Press**: Reach out to music blogs (Stereofox, Acid Stag, etc.)
5. **Algorithm optimization**: Once you have 10+ uploads, analyze what YouTube promotes organically

## Weekly Distribution Rhythm (Once Established)

**Week 1-2 (Pre-Upload)**:
- Plan mix, record, edit

**Week 2 (Upload Day)**:
- Publish to YouTube
- Distribute across platforms (1-2 hrs)

**Week 2-4 (Post-Upload)**:
- Engage with comments
- Share in new Discord servers
- Test new distribution channels
- Analyze traffic sources

**Week 4 (Repeat)**:
- Start next mix

---

## Key Principle

**One channel done well > five channels half-assed.**

Start with YouTube + Reddit + Discord. Master those. Then expand.
