# Prioritized Task Backlog

**Last Updated**: [Date]

**How to use this**:
- **P0** = Blocking. Must be done before next upload. Do immediately.
- **P1** = Important. Should be done within 2 weeks. Significantly improves results.
- **P2** = Nice to have. Do when P0/P1 are clear. Incremental gains.

**Review this file weekly.** Move completed tasks to `/backlog/completed.md`.
