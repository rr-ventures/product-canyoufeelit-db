## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Forgetting to pin your CTA comment (do this FIRST after publishing)
❌ Using auto-generated thumbnail (kills CTR)
❌ Not timestamping tracklist (viewers will ask for it)
❌ Publishing at a random time (experiment with consistent schedule: Fri/Sat evenings = best for late-night vibe content)
❌ Over-tagging (15 tags max, quality > quantity)
❌ Not checking audio sync before publishing

---

## Ideal Upload Schedule

**Recommended**: Fridays or Saturdays, 6-9pm (viewer's local time = evening/night = peak listening for your vibe)

**Consistency > Timing**: If you can only upload Tuesdays at 2pm, that's fine—just be consistent.
