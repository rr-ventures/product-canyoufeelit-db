# Stop Doing This — Anti-Pattern List

You identified "overbuilding" as your trap. Here are 10+ specific things to **stop** immediately:

---

## 1. Waiting for the Perfect Logo
**Stop**: Iterating on logo designs before uploading your first mix.
**Reality**: Your first 1,000 views won't care about your logo. Ship with a simple text-based thumbnail if needed.
**Do instead**: Use a template or placeholder. Lock logo decision after Mix 3.

---

## 2. Reading More Books on YouTube Strategy
**Stop**: Consuming more content about "how to YouTube."
**Reality**: You already know enough. Execution > education at this stage.
**Do instead**: Upload first. Learn from actual data, not theory.

---

## 3. Overproducing Mixes (30+ Tracks)
**Stop**: Building 60-minute mixes with 40 tracks because "more is better."
**Reality**: 20-30 min = faster shipping, more releases, less burnout.
**Do instead**: 10-15 tracks max. Quality over length.

---

## 4. Vetting Every Track for Copyright Risk
**Stop**: Building elaborate systems to predict copyright claims.
**Reality**: You accepted claims. Just upload. YouTube will tell you.
**Do instead**: Ship the mix. If something gets claimed, note it for future reference.

---

## 5. Designing "The Perfect" Email Funnel
**Stop**: Building complex lead magnets, tripwires, and multi-step sequences before you have 100 subscribers.
**Reality**: You need 10 email addresses first, not a marketing funnel.
**Do instead**: One simple form. One simple promise: "New finds weekly."

---

## 6. Researching Every Platform Before Launching
**Stop**: Trying to master YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Discord, SoundCloud simultaneously.
**Reality**: You have 5 hours/week. One platform done well > five platforms half-assed.
**Do instead**: YouTube only for Month 1. Add distribution in Month 2.

---

## 7. Writing SEO-Optimized Descriptions Before Understanding What Works
**Stop**: Agonizing over keyword density and metadata before you have any data.
**Reality**: YouTube's algorithm prioritizes watch time and CTR over description keywords.
**Do instead**: Use a template. Iterate after 3 uploads based on performance.

---

## 8. Building a Website Before You Have Traffic
**Stop**: Designing a landing page with custom branding, animations, and email capture.
**Reality**: No one's visiting your site yet. You don't need it for Week 1.
**Do instead**: Use a free Carrd/Linktree page with one email form. Ship in 20 minutes.

---

## 9. Organizing Your Entire 15,000-Song Library
**Stop**: Building the "perfect" tagging/filing system for every track before creating Mix 1.
**Reality**: You don't need the whole library organized—just the 10-15 tracks in *this* mix.
**Do instead**: Curate per-mix. Tag as you go.

---

## 10. Seeking Permission/Validation Before Shipping
**Stop**: Asking "is this good enough?" or "should I change X before uploading?"
**Reality**: The audience decides, not you. Ship and iterate.
**Do instead**: If it passes your 2am test (would you listen to this?), upload it.

---

## 11. Overthinking Titles
**Stop**: A/B testing 15 title variations before uploading.
**Reality**: You don't have enough data to know what works yet.
**Do instead**: Use the template (emotion + vibe + format). Move on.

---

## 12. Comparing Your First Video to Channels with 500K Subs
**Stop**: Watching established channels and thinking "mine needs to be that polished."
**Reality**: Their first video was probably worse than yours.
**Do instead**: Compare to *your* last upload, not someone else's highlight reel.

---

## 13. Building Elaborate Project Management Systems
**Stop**: Creating Notion boards with 47 database properties and color-coded tags.
**Reality**: Complexity = friction. Friction = procrastination.
**Do instead**: Use this repo. Markdown files. Checkboxes. Done.

---

## 14. "Researching Competitors" as Procrastination
**Stop**: Watching 40 other mix channels "for research" instead of working.
**Reality**: You already know your differentiator (emotional depth + DJ craft).
**Do instead**: Watch 3 competitors max. Note one thing each does well. Move on.

---

## 15. Trying to Solve Month 6 Problems in Week 1
**Stop**: Planning your label, merch, sponsorships, SoundCloud distribution strategy.
**Reality**: You have zero uploads. These are distractions disguised as "vision."
**Do instead**: Focus on the next 14 days only. Everything else is backlog.

---

## The One-Sentence Rule

**If it doesn't directly contribute to uploading your first mix in 7 days, stop doing it.**

---

## Allowed Exceptions (Do These Instead)

- Curating tracks for Mix 1
- Recording Mix 1
- Creating a thumbnail (even a basic one)
- Writing title + description from template
- Uploading to YouTube
- Posting one place for distribution
- Sending one email to your list (even if it's 3 people)

Everything else: **backlog.**
