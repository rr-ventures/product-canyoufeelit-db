# Platform Setup Checklist — Establish Your Presence

**Use this to create accounts and verify your brand across platforms.**

## Brand Consistency Checklist

Ensure these are consistent across ALL platforms:

- [ ] **Handle/Username**: @canyoufeelitmixes (or closest variant)
- [ ] **Tagline**: "Trip hop mixes that land" or "For people who feel it"
- [ ] **Profile pic**: Same logo/icon everywhere
- [ ] **Link**: Landing page URL (not direct YouTube link)
- [ ] **Bio/About**: Similar language/vibe (emotional, authentic, no fluff)

---

## Security & Admin

- [ ] **Use password manager** (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.) for all accounts
- [ ] **Enable 2FA** on YouTube, email tool, Discord (minimum)
- [ ] **Save all account credentials** in secure location
- [ ] **Document recovery emails** (in case of lockout)

## Notes

- **Don't create accounts you won't maintain.** Better to do 3 platforms well than 10 poorly.
- **Username consistency matters.** Try to get @canyoufeelitmixes everywhere (or closest variant).
- **Link everything back to landing page.** Not YouTube—your owned asset.
- **Verify important accounts** (Twitter, Instagram) once you're eligible.
