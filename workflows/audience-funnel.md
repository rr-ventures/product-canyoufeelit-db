# Owned Audience Funnel — YouTube to Email/Discord

**Goal**: Convert passive YouTube viewers into owned audience (email subscribers + Discord members).

**Why this matters**: YouTube can change the algorithm, demonetize, or ban you. Email + Discord = assets you own.

## Stage 1: YouTube (Awareness)

**Objective**: Get someone to click play

**Key elements**:
- **Thumbnail**: Emotion + visual intrigue (not generic)
- **Title**: Specific feeling + genre (optimized for search)
- **First 15 seconds**: Best moment of the mix (hook them immediately)

**Conversion goal**: 10% CTR (click-through rate from impressions)

---

## Stage 2: Video Experience (Engagement)

**Objective**: Keep them listening long enough to care

**Key elements**:
- **Track quality**: Every song passes the "2am test"
- **DJ craft**: Smooth transitions, no dead air
- **Tracklist**: Timestamped so they can find gems
- **Description**: Emotional hook in first 2 sentences

**Conversion goal**: 50%+ average watch time

---

## Stage 3: CTA (Call to Action)

**Objective**: Get them to click the link

**Key elements**:
- **Pinned comment** (posted immediately after publish):
  ```
  If this mix resonates with you, there's more where it came from.

  💌 Weekly track finds + meaning (no spam): [link]
  💬 Discord for people who get it: [link]

  What track hit different for you? 👇
  ```
- **End screen** (last 20 seconds): Visual CTA pointing to landing page
- **Description**: CTAs appear twice (mid-description + bottom)

**Conversion goal**: 5-10% click-through to landing page

---

## Stage 4: Landing Page (Capture)

**Objective**: Convert click into email signup or Discord join

**Key elements**:
- **Headline**: "For people who feel it" or similar (emotional alignment)
- **Subheadline**: "Get weekly track finds + the meaning behind them. No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
- **Email form**: Name + Email (keep it simple)
- **Discord button**: "Or join the Discord →"
- **Social proof** (after 10+ signups): "Join 50+ others who vibe with this"

**Conversion goal**: 30-50% of landing page visitors sign up

**Tools**: Carrd (free), Linktree (free), or simple GoHighLevel page

---

## Stage 5: Welcome Sequence (Activation)

**Objective**: Deliver value immediately so they don't unsubscribe

### Email Welcome (sent immediately after signup):
**Subject**: `welcome — here's what you just signed up for`

**Body**:
```
Hey [First Name],

Thanks for joining. You're now part of a small group of people who get it.

Here's what to expect:
- Every week or two, I'll send you 3 track discoveries + what they mean
- No sales pitches, no spam, just resonance
- You can reply anytime—I actually read these

First rec: [One track with 2-sentence description + link]

Until next time,
—

### Discord Welcome (pinned in #general):
```
👋 Welcome to Can You Feel It

This is a space for people who don't just hear music—they feel it.

3 channels:
- #general: Introduce yourself, share what you're listening to
- #mix-feedback: Honest thoughts on the mixes (what landed, what didn't)
- #track-sharing: Drop gems you've found

No rules except: be real. If you're here for clout or promo, this isn't the place.

What brought you here? Drop a message below 👇
```

## Stage 6: Ongoing Engagement (Retention)

**Objective**: Keep them engaged so they stay subscribed and become superfans

### Email (weekly or fortnightly):
- 3 track finds with emotional context
- Personal reflection on the theme
- Soft mention of new mix (if uploaded recently)
- Question at the end to prompt replies

**Churn goal**: <5% unsubscribe rate

### Discord (ongoing):
- Share mix previews before YouTube upload
- Ask for feedback on track selection
- Host "track of the week" discussions
- Celebrate milestones (100 subs, 1K views, etc.)

**Engagement goal**: 20-30% of members active weekly

---

## Stage 7: Advocacy (Growth Loop)

**Objective**: Turn superfans into advocates who share your work

**Tactics**:
- End each email with: "Know someone who'd vibe with this? Forward it."
- Pin Discord message: "Invite a friend who gets it"
- Feature listener track recommendations in mixes (with credit)
- Create "listener-requested mix" (crowd-sourced theme)

**Conversion goal**: 10-20% of engaged audience shares your content

## Optimization Playbook (After 3+ Uploads)

### If YouTube CTR is low (<5%):
- Test new thumbnail style
- Test emotion-first vs vibe-first titles
- Improve first 15 seconds of mix (stronger hook)

### If watch time is low (<40%):
- Review track selection (are they actually gems?)
- Check transitions (are they smooth or jarring?)
- Shorten mixes (20min may perform better than 30min)

### If landing page CTR is low (<3%):
- Make pinned comment more compelling
- Add end screen CTA
- Test different CTA copy in description

### If email signup rate is low (<20%):
- Simplify landing page (fewer words, clearer value prop)
- Add social proof
- Test "Join Discord" as primary CTA instead

### If email open rate drops (<30%):
- Test different subject lines (more personal, less formal)
- Check send time (Fri/Sat evenings may work better)
- Audit content quality (are you delivering on the promise?)

## Revenue Potential (Long-Term)

**Note**: You're not monetizing yet. This is for reference only.

Once you have 500+ engaged email subscribers + 200+ Discord members:
- **Patreon**: $5-10/mo for exclusive mixes, early access, stems
- **Merch**: Simple designs for superfans (print-on-demand)
- **Label**: Release other artists' tracks, take small % of streaming revenue
- **Sponsorships**: Audio equipment brands, music platforms (if aligned)

**Rule**: Only monetize if it *adds* value. Never extract value.

---

## Key Principle

**The funnel is not about manipulation. It's about deepening the relationship with people who already vibe with your work.**

If someone doesn't sign up, that's fine. You gave them a great mix. That's enough.

The ones who sign up? They're your people. Treat them accordingly.
