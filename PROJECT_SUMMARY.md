**Last Updated**: 2026-01-14

This document provides a high-level overview of the entire project structure and how to use it.

## What Is This?

A complete rollout system for a trip-hop/lofi YouTube mix channel that prioritizes:
1. **Shipping fast** (Mix 1 in 7 days)
2. **Building owned audience** (email + Discord)
3. **Emotional resonance** over algorithmic gaming
4. **Pragmatic systems** over perfectionism

---

## Quick Navigation

### Start Here
- **[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)** ← Read this first. 7-day plan to upload Mix 1.
- **[BRAND_MANIFESTO.md](./BRAND_MANIFESTO.md)** ← Why this exists. Your North Star.

### Planning & Execution

- **[Upload Checklist](./workflows/upload-checklist.md)** — Use on every upload
- **[Stop Doing This](./workflows/stop-doing-this.md)** — Anti-patterns to avoid
- **[Prioritized Backlog](./backlog/prioritized-tasks.md)** — P0/P1/P2 task lists

### Templates & Tools
- **[Title/Description Templates](./templates/title-description-template.md)** — Copy/paste metadata
- **[Newsletter Template](./templates/newsletter-template.md)** — Email writing guide
- **[Scripts](./scripts/)** — Python tools for automation (tracklist formatter, metadata generator)

### Strategy & Research

## Project Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Momentum over perfection** — Ship first, polish later
2. **One platform done well > five half-assed** — Master YouTube before expanding
3. **Owned assets > rented attention** — Email/Discord > YouTube subs
4. **Emotional truth > algorithmic tricks** — Serve humans, not bots
5. **Systems over motivation** — Build repeatable processes

### What Success Looks Like
- **Month 1**: Mix 1 uploaded, landing page live, email capture working
- **Month 3**: 3 mixes live, 50 email subs, clear distribution rhythm
- **Month 6**: 6-10 mixes, 200+ email subs, engaged Discord community
- **Month 12**: 12-20 mixes, 500+ email subs, sustainable content pipeline

### What This Is NOT
- A get-rich-quick scheme (no monetization Year 1)
- A generic lofi playlist channel (emotional depth is non-negotiable)
- An SEO farm (serve people who vibe, not algorithms)
- A side hustle with KPIs (passion project with pragmatic systems)

## Key Artifacts by Purpose

### "I'm stuck. What do I do next?"
→ Read `QUICKSTART.md` or check `prioritized-tasks.md` (P0 section)

### "How do I write a good title/description?"
→ Use `templates/title-description-template.md`

### "How do I upload to YouTube?"
→ Follow `workflows/upload-checklist.md`

### "How do I write a newsletter?"
→ Use `templates/newsletter-template.md`

### "What are competitors doing?"
→ Fill out `research/competitor-analysis.md`

### "Where should I distribute this mix?"
→ Read `research/distribution-strategy.md`

### "How do I turn viewers into email subs?"
→ Read `workflows/audience-funnel.md`

### "I'm overbuilding again. How do I stop?"
→ Read `workflows/stop-doing-this.md`

---

## Decision Framework

When you're unsure what to do, ask:

1. **Does this help me upload my next mix?** (If no → backlog)
2. **Does this build my owned audience?** (If no → deprioritize)
3. **Would I do this if I only had 1 hour this week?** (If no → P2)
4. **Am I overthinking because I'm scared to ship?** (If yes → read `stop-doing-this.md`)

---

## Maintenance

### Weekly
- [ ] Review `prioritized-tasks.md` (move P0 → P1 → P2 as needed)
- [ ] Check YouTube analytics after each upload
- [ ] Send newsletter (if on weekly cadence)
- [ ] Respond to comments/DMs

### Monthly
- [ ] Update `competitor-analysis.md` (what's working in the niche?)
- [ ] Review distribution experiments (what drove traffic?)
- [ ] Clean up completed tasks (archive in `backlog/completed.md`)

### Quarterly
- [ ] Reflect on progress (views, subs, email list, Discord engagement)
- [ ] Adjust strategy based on data (double down on what works)
- [ ] Revisit `BRAND_MANIFESTO.md` (are you staying true to it?)

## What to Add to This Repo

1. **Your song collections** — Put raw song lists in `/content/track-inbox.md`
2. **Your logo/banner drafts** — Add to `/assets/logos/` and `/assets/banners/`
3. **Mix files** (optional) — Store in `/content/mixes/` if you want to version-control them
4. **Analytics snapshots** — Track performance over time in `/research/analytics/`

---

## What NOT to Add

- Mix audio files (too large for git—store in Google Drive or local archive)
- Paid course downloads (use what you have here instead)
- 50 logo iterations (pick 1-2 finalists, delete the rest)

---

## Getting Help

If you're blocked:
1. Re-read `QUICKSTART.md`
2. Check `stop-doing-this.md` (are you overbuilding?)
3. Ask yourself: "What's the smallest next step I can take?"
4. Do that step. Ship it. Move on.

---

## Final Reminder

**The goal is not to build the perfect system. The goal is to ship Mix 1.**

Everything else is noise until you've uploaded your first video.

You've got the roadmap. Now execute.
