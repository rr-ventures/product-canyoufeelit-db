## 🎯 Your Mission (In Case You Forgot)

From **[BRAND_MANIFESTO.md](./BRAND_MANIFESTO.md)**:

> "Music isn't background noise. It's a state of being. The right song—at the right moment—doesn't just sound good. It *lands*. It bypasses the mind entirely and hits something deeper."

You're building a channel for **late-night feelers**—young adults who don't just want "chill vibes," they want music that *gets it*.

**Your unfair advantage**:
1. 15,000-song library of hand-picked gems
2. Real DJ craft (not playlist compilers)
3. Emotional depth (not surface-level "chill")

## 🚫 Anti-Pattern Alert

You said you get stuck **overbuilding** (e.g., perfect logo before shipping).

**Read this list now**: [Stop Doing This](./workflows/stop-doing-this.md)

**Golden rule**: If it doesn't help you upload Mix 1 in 7 days, it's a distraction.
