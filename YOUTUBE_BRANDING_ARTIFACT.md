# YOUTUBE BRANDING ARTIFACT: "Can You Feel It"

> Use this document to understand the complete brand identity, mission, voice, strategy, and intent behind the "Can You Feel It" YouTube channel. This is a self-contained reference for any AI model or collaborator helping with content, copy, strategy, or creative decisions.

---

## 1. BRAND IDENTITY

**Channel Name:** Can You Feel It
**Genre:** Trip hop / downtempo / emotional electronic mixes
**Format:** Curated DJ mixes (20-30 minutes), uploaded every 2-4 weeks
**Tagline:** "For people who feel it"
**Alternate Tagline:** "Trip hop mixes that don't just sound good -- they land"

**Core Question (The Standard):**
Not "can you hear it" or "do you like it" -- the question is **"Can you *feel* it?"**
If a track doesn't evoke something real, it doesn't go in the mix. Period.

---

## 2. MISSION

Music saved the creator during a rough childhood and hard times. It was a way to process emotions they didn't understand. This channel pays that forward. If one teenager finds one song in one mix that helps them through one hard night -- it was worth it.

---

## 3. VISION

1. A YouTube channel proving emotional depth and algorithmic success aren't mutually exclusive
2. An email list for sharing track discoveries, stories, and meaning -- not sales pitches
3. A Discord community for people who "get it"
4. A long-term asset that could become a label, a movement, or a catalog of work the creator is proud of

---

## 4. CORE PHILOSOPHY

Music isn't background noise. It's not productivity fuel or ambience. Music is a state of being. The right song at the right moment doesn't just sound good -- it *lands*. It bypasses the mind and hits something deeper: the part of you that knows without thinking, that feels without explaining. That's resonance. That's what this channel exists for.

**The Litmus Test:** If the creator wouldn't listen to it at 2am when feeling something they can't name, it doesn't go in the mix.

---

## 5. THE PROBLEM BEING SOLVED

Young adults -- students, late-night thinkers, the emotionally restless -- search YouTube for mixes that promise depth. They click on titles like "you need to go to sleep now" or "I miss her" hoping for resonance. What they get: generic lofi. No story. No soul. Just algorithmic background noise. They're promised emotional truth and given elevator music.

---

## 6. TARGET AUDIENCE

**Primary: "The Late-Night Feeler"**
- **Age:** 16-25
- **Psychographic:** Processing emotions they don't have words for yet
- **State:** Yearning, angsty, nostalgic, searching
- **NOT looking for:** Study beats, focus music, background noise
- **Looking for:** Someone who gets it
- **Emotional response when they find the channel:** Not just liking it -- *gratitude*. Because it gives them permission to feel. A soundtrack for what they're going through.

---

## 7. THREE UNFAIR ADVANTAGES

1. **15,000+ song library** -- A decade of hand-collecting gems. Not Spotify playlists, not algorithm-generated. Tracks that stop you mid-scroll.
2. **Real DJ craft** -- Key changes, BPM shifts, looping, editing. This isn't a playlist on shuffle. It's a story arc.
3. **Real emotional intent** -- Every mix has a thesis, a feeling, a moment in time. Titles are promises kept, not SEO bait.

---

## 8. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

| Most mix channels | Can You Feel It |
|---|---|
| Background music (study/focus) | Foreground listening (music for *feeling*) |
| Algorithm-optimized, generic thumbnails | Emotional authenticity, titles are promises kept |
| Quantity over quality | 1 mix every 2-4 weeks, high curation |
| YouTube subs as primary metric | Owned audience (email + Discord) |
| Playlist compilers | Actual DJ craft with story arcs |

**Positioning Statement:** The only trip-hop mix channel with actual DJ craft, emotional depth, and a decade of curation behind every mix.

---

## 9. CORE VALUES & PRINCIPLES

1. **Momentum over perfection** -- Ship first, polish later
2. **One platform done well > five half-assed** -- Master YouTube before expanding
3. **Owned assets > rented attention** -- Email/Discord > YouTube subs
4. **Emotional truth > algorithmic tricks** -- Serve humans, not bots
5. **Systems over motivation** -- Build repeatable processes

**Anti-goal:** No monetization in Year 1. This is not a get-rich-quick scheme, a generic lofi channel, an SEO farm, or a side hustle with KPIs. It's a passion project with pragmatic systems.

**Monetization rule (long-term):** Only monetize if it *adds* value. Never extract value.

---

## 10. VOICE & TONE

### General Voice
- Direct, honest, no irony, no cleverness
- Emotionally specific (not "sad" -- "the kind of sad where you're grateful for the ache")
- Intimate and lowercase -- like texting a friend at 2am
- Conversational, short paragraphs, line breaks
- Personal -- share what the creator is feeling/listening to

### What the Voice is NOT
- Marketing jargon ("exclusive content," "don't miss out")
- Formal blog-post paragraphs
- Over-explained or over-produced
- Salesy or promotional

**Golden Rule:** If it feels like marketing, delete it. This is a letter to friends, not a campaign.

---

## 11. TITLE & METADATA STRATEGY

**Title Formula:** [Emotion/State] + [Vibe/Genre] + [Format]

**Examples:**
- `when you finally let go | trip hop mix`
- `late night thoughts | lofi beats for feeling something`
- `the comfort of solitude | downtempo mix`
- `I miss who I used to be | emotional trip hop`
- `safe space for your feelings | 25min chill mix`
- `you don't need to explain | lofi for the restless`

**Title Rules:**
- Max 60-70 characters
- Lead with emotion/state (that's the hook)
- Lowercase for intimacy
- No clickbait -- deliver on the promise
- No dates or episode numbers (kills evergreen potential)

**Description Structure:**
1. Emotional hook (1-2 sentences)
2. Timestamped tracklist
3. 2 CTAs: landing page (email) + Discord
4. Relevant hashtags

---

## 12. EMAIL / NEWSLETTER VOICE

**Purpose:** Share new finds + meaning. Not selling. Not promoting. Just resonance.
**Frequency:** Weekly or fortnightly (pick one, stick to it)
**Length:** 300-400 words max

**Subject Line Formula:** [Feeling/State] + [What's Inside]
Examples:
- `3 tracks for when you're feeling too much`
- `this week's finds: solitude + longing`
- `new mix + the song that started it all`

**Structure:**
1. Personal opening (1-2 sentences about the creator's week)
2. 3 track recommendations with emotional context
3. Closing thought connecting the tracks
4. Teaser of new mix
5. Optional PS with question or call-to-action

---

## 13. AUDIENCE FUNNEL

```
YouTube Mix (viewer watches 50%+ watch time)
    -> Reads description / pinned comment
    -> Clicks link to landing page
    -> Signs up for email OR joins Discord
    -> Receives welcome email / sees Discord welcome
    -> Engages with weekly emails / Discord
    -> Becomes superfan (shares, replies, requests)
```

**Key principle:** The funnel is not about manipulation. It's about deepening the relationship with people who already vibe with the work.

---

## 14. DISTRIBUTION TIERS

**Tier 1 (Core Focus):**
1. YouTube -- Primary home
2. Reddit -- Organic discovery (r/triphop, r/lofihiphop, etc.)
3. Music Discord servers -- Community seeding, direct feedback

**Tier 2 (After 3 uploads):**
4. Instagram (visual teasers)
5. TikTok (high-risk, high-reward)

**Tier 3 (Longer term):**
6. SoundCloud (backup presence)
7. Twitter/X (optional)

---

## 15. SUCCESS MILESTONES

| Timeframe | Target |
|---|---|
| Month 1 | Mix 1 uploaded, landing page live, email capture working |
| Month 3 | 3 mixes live, 50 email subs, clear distribution rhythm |
| Month 6 | 6-10 mixes, 200+ email subs, engaged Discord community |
| Month 12 | 12-20 mixes, 500+ email subs, sustainable content pipeline |

---

## 16. LONG-TERM POSSIBILITIES (Only after 500+ email subs & 200+ Discord members)

- **Patreon:** $5-10/mo for exclusive mixes, early access, stems
- **Merch:** Simple designs for superfans (print-on-demand)
- **Label:** Release other artists' tracks
- **Sponsorships:** Audio equipment brands, music platforms (if aligned)

---

## 17. ANTI-PATTERNS (What to Never Do)

- Wait for perfection before shipping
- Over-produce mixes (30+ tracks)
- Write SEO-optimized descriptions before understanding what works
- Build elaborate systems before having content live
- Compare early work to channels with 500K subs
- Chase views instead of resonance
- Use the channel as background-music content
- Monetize before adding real value
- Batch-write emails in advance (loses authenticity)

**The One-Sentence Rule:** If it doesn't directly contribute to uploading the next mix, stop doing it.

## HOW TO USE THIS ARTIFACT

When helping with this channel, apply these filters to any output:

1. **Does it feel honest?** If it reads like marketing copy, rewrite it.
2. **Would the Late-Night Feeler connect with it?** If it's generic, go deeper.
3. **Does it pass the 2am test?** If you wouldn't engage with it alone at night while processing something real, it's not right for this brand.
4. **Is it simple and shippable?** If it requires elaborate setup before being useful, simplify.
5. **Does it serve resonance over reach?** If it optimizes for clicks over connection, recalibrate.
