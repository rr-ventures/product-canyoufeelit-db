# Title + Description Templates

## Title Formula

**[Emotion/State] + [Vibe/Genre] + [Format]**

### Examples:
- `when you finally let go | trip hop mix`
- `late night thoughts | lofi beats for feeling something`
- `the comfort of solitude | downtempo mix`
- `I miss who I used to be | emotional trip hop`
- `safe space for your feelings | 25min chill mix`
- `you don't need to explain | lofi for the restless`

### Rules:
- Max 60-70 characters (shows fully in search results)
- Lead with emotion/state (this is your hook)
- Use lowercase for intimacy (exception: proper nouns)
- No clickbait—deliver on the promise
- No dates/episode numbers in title (kills evergreen potential)

## Emotional Hook Examples (Use One Per Mix)

- *"For the nights when you're wide awake but your mind won't stop. This one's for processing what you can't put into words."*
- *"Sometimes you need music that doesn't try to fix you—it just sits with you. This is that mix."*
- *"For the quiet moments between who you were and who you're becoming."*
- *"When nostalgia hits different at 2am and you're not sure if you're sad or grateful. This is your soundtrack."*
- *"For anyone who's ever felt too much and didn't know where to put it. You're not alone."*

## Tracklist Formatting

**Format**:
```
[MM:SS] Artist — Track Title
```

**Example**:
```
00:00 Bonobo — Cirrus
04:23 Emancipator — Safe In The Steep Cliffs
08:45 Blockhead — The Music Scene
12:10 Gramatik — Satoshi Nakamoto
```

**Rules**:
- Always include timestamps (YouTube auto-generates chapters if formatted correctly)
- Use em dash (—) not hyphen (-) between artist and title
- Double-check spelling of artist/track names (viewers will search for them)
- List in order of appearance in mix

## SEO Notes

### What Matters:
1. **Title** — Primary ranking factor
2. **First 2 sentences of description** — Shows in search results
3. **Thumbnail CTR** — Affects ranking heavily
4. **Watch time** — Most important algo signal

### What Doesn't Matter (Much):
- Keyword stuffing in description
- Excessive tags (10-15 is plenty)
- Description length (keep it useful, not exhaustive)

### YouTube Search Behavior for This Niche:
- Users search for **feelings** not genres ("sad lofi mix" > "lofi hip hop beats")
- Long-tail keywords win ("late night study music for anxiety" > "study music")
- Evergreen > trending (your content should work in 2 years, not 2 weeks)

## A/B Testing Ideas (After 3+ Uploads)

Once you have baseline data, test ONE variable at a time:
- Emotion-first titles vs vibe-first titles
- Lowercase vs title case
- Specific feelings ("when she doesn't text back") vs general ("late night thoughts")
- Static thumbnail vs subtle animation
