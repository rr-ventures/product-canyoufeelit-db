# Newsletter Template

**Frequency**: Weekly or fortnightly (choose one and stick to it)

**Goal**: Share new finds + meaning. Not selling. Not promoting. Just resonance.

## Subject Line Formula

**[Feeling/State] + [What's Inside]**

### Examples:
- `3 tracks for when you're feeling too much`
- `this week's finds: solitude + longing`
- `new mix + the song that started it all`
- `for the quiet moments (+ this week's gems)`

**Rules**:
- Lowercase for intimacy
- No emoji (unless it really fits your brand—test it)
- Promise value, not clickbait
- Max 50 characters

Hey,

It's 1am and I'm staring at my ceiling again. You know that feeling when your mind won't quiet down, but you're not *anxious*—you're just... processing? These tracks are for that.

Here's what landed this week:

---

🎧 **Tycho — A Walk**
This one doesn't try to fix you. It just sits with you. Perfect for staring out windows and letting your thoughts drift. The kind of track that makes 2am feel like a safe place.
[Listen: Spotify link]

🎧 **Bonobo — Kerala**
There's a moment around 3:20 where everything drops away and it's just you and the bass. If you've ever felt homesick for a place you've never been, you'll get this one.
[Listen: Spotify link]

🎧 **Emancipator — Lionheart**
Nostalgia in audio form. This is what hope sounds like when it's tired but not giving up. Play it when you need a reminder that you've made it through hard nights before.
[Listen: Spotify link]

I've been thinking a lot about why we gravitate toward these sounds when we're feeling something we can't name. I think it's because they don't demand anything from us. They just... *get it*.

New mix dropping Friday: "the comfort of solitude." 25 minutes of tracks for when being alone feels like exactly what you need.

Until next time,
—

p.s. What's one track that's been living in your head lately? Hit reply—I actually read these.

## Writing Tips

### Do:
- Write like you're texting a friend at 2am
- Be specific about feelings (not "sad"—"the kind of sad where you're grateful for the ache")
- Keep it short (300-400 words max)
- Use conversational formatting (short paragraphs, line breaks)
- Make it personal (share what YOU'RE feeling/listening to)

### Don't:
- Sell anything (not yet—this is pure value for first 6 months)
- Use marketing jargon ("exclusive content," "don't miss out," etc.)
- Write formal paragraphs (this isn't a blog post)
- Over-explain tracks (2-3 sentences is enough)
- Batch-write 10 emails in advance (loses authenticity—write week-of)

---

## Content Bank (When You're Stuck)

### Email Ideas:
1. **3 tracks for [specific feeling]**
2. **Behind the mix: How I chose the tracks for [Mix Name]**
3. **One song that changed everything for me**
4. **Tracks I've been sitting with this week**
5. **For when you need to feel something (+ 3 gems)**
6. **The mix I almost didn't upload (+ why I did)**
7. **Late-night listening report: [Theme]**

### When You Have Writer's Block:
- Pick ONE track that hit you hard this week
- Write 3 sentences about how it made you feel
- Add 2 more tracks that fit the vibe
- Send it

**Done is better than perfect.**

## Growth Strategy (Non-Spammy)

### In first 3 months:
- End each email with: *"Know someone who'd vibe with this? Forward it to them."*
- No referral programs, no incentives—just organic sharing

### After 100 subscribers:
- Occasionally ask: *"What are you feeling lately? Reply and I might build a mix around it."*
- Feature listener responses (with permission) in future emails

### After 500 subscribers:
- Consider a simple "mixtape request" form where subscribers submit a feeling/moment and you curate a short list of tracks

**Golden rule**: If it feels like marketing, delete it. This is a letter to friends, not a campaign.
